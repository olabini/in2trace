- support restrictions on what ips and ports to use (maybe libpcap)
- add support for batch mode (so that a parser can easily consume it)
- look at ASN
- Make it possible to ONLY run the listener part if wanted (passive mode)
- Add reaping at end of Display (put a time stamp for last mtime on each thing)
